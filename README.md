## Agenda

9:00-09:30 &ensp; Registration, poster set up and coffee.

9:30-09:45 &ensp; Welcome to the Fringe event
> By [Prof. Eduardo Alonso](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/eduardo-alonso), [Prof. Artur d'Avila Garcez](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~aag/) and [Dr. Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/ernesto-jimenez-ruiz).

9:45-10:30 &ensp; Keynote 1 (30 min + 15 min questions). Session Chair: [Prof. Eduardo Alonso](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/eduardo-alonso)
> **Speaker:**  [Prof. Michael Fisher](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~michael/) (University of Manchester)
>
> **Title:** Is there a path to Trustworthy AI?
>
> **Abstract:** AI is very popular at present. But when we deploy it, especially in important or even critical situations, do we know what this use of AI will result in? And should we trust it to always work "well"? I will discuss general issues around the development of Trustworthy AI, and the broader governance of AI. These include verification (does it work?), beneficiality (is it working for our benefit?), and the analysis of these both before and after deployment.
> 
> **Bio:** Michael Fisher is a Professor of Computer Science and the Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. His research concerns autonomous systems, particularly verification, software engineering, self-awareness, and trustworthiness, with applications across robotics and autonomous vehicles. Increasingly, his work encompasses not just safety but broader ethical issues such as sustainability and responsibility across these (AI, Autonomous Systems, IoT, Robotics, etc) technologies. Fisher co-chairs the IEEE Technical Committee on the Verification of Autonomous Systems, chairs the BSI Committee on Sustainable Robotics, is a member of  the IEEE P7009 Standards committee on Fail-Safe Design of Autonomous Systems, and is a member of the Strategy Group of the UK's Responsible AI programme. He is currently on secondment (2 days per week) to the UK Government's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, advising on issues around AI and Robotics.

> **Speaker:**  [Prof. Francesca Toni](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/f.toni) (Imperial College London)
>
> **Title:** Interactive Explanations for Trustworthy AI.
>
> **Abstract:** AI has grown massively in the last ten years or so, predominantly due to increased processing power availability, big data and powerful statistical and probabilistic models to support machine learning and reasoning as vector (rather than symbol) manipulation. The resulting AI models tend to be inscrutable black-boxes, whose trustworthiness may be doubtful, given that artifacts and biases may be present in  these models. In this talk I will explore the role that interactive explanations, supported by computational argumentation, may have towards the trustworthiness  of AI models.
> 
> **Bio:** Francesca Toni is a Professor in Computational Logic and Royal Academy of Engineering/JP Morgan Research Chair in Argumentation-based Interactive Explainable AI, in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, where she is a member of the Artificial Intelligence research theme and the leader of the CLArg (Computational Logic and Argumentation) research group. She is also a member of the GLAM research group and of the AI@Imperial Network of Excellence at Imperial College London, and the founding leader of the Centre for eXplainable AI (XAI).
